# ToxicCommentsExtension-hackathon
a Chrome extension to block \ hide toxic comments from social media.


Using ML (Azure ML Studio) we built a classifying algorithm to classify comments' text as "Toxic" or "Non Toxic".
We plugged it into a Chrome extension to filter \ hide toxic comments on FB, You Tube and Reddit.

We hacked this project as part of the One Week Hackathon at Microsoft SVC (Mountain View, CA).
